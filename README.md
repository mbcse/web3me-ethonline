# Web3.Me
An easy to use platform for non-technical users to track and visualise there wallet data.

# About
In today's world its important that people can see whats happening with there account address and what assets they hold in clean and easy fashion. We have a lot of explorers, wallets, but all are not user friendly and a general user who only knows about just his/her wallet address can't go to these explorers and see data. For this web3.me is made where a user can see what he/she is holding and what exactly is happening with the wallet they are having.

# How it is built
It is built using quicknode(Really great stuff), moralis and ipfs. Works on CRONOS AND POLYGON MAINNET CHAIN. Api's and system is built in nodejs which fetches user data, aggregates and converts that data in easy format and then display it on ui. Html/css/ejs/javascript/nodejs are used to build this platform. IPFS is used to see metadata and visualize the data stored there with links of nft.storage, metadata.storage. etc.
